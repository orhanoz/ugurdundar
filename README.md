UGUR DUNDAR
 
right now you can use the class file as version 1.0
 
so what it does:
  -you pass an url
  -it prints out the tags
  -do your removings and searchs in between tags
  -after finding the tag let Ugur Dundar do his job 
  -he will print all the info inside the tag
  -and start looking for new stuff to come
  
  this is basicly how ugur dundar operates
  
  usage : python class.py -h or --help will show you the correct usage
          python class.py -u or --url is the only available parameter right now
                          after -u or --url pass the url without http://
          you can also run it without any parameter in that case ugur dundar will ask for an url
 example: python class.py -u foo.com
 
 
 next version will be available soon...
    current ideas:
         -external logging
         -timing setting
         -multiple urls 
         -multiple sessions
         -time stamping
         -key word searching
